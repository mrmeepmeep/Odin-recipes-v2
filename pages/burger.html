    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 sesame-topped burger buns</li>
        <li>300g steak mince</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>small wedfe of iceberg lettuce, finely shredded</li>
        <li>2 slices of mild cheddar or burger cheese</li>
        <li>gherkin sliced lengthways</li>
        <li>oven fries, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the secret sauce</h3>
    <li>100g mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 tbsp American mustard</li>
    <li>large pinch garlic granules</li>
    <li>large pinch onion granules</li>
    <li>¼ tsp smoked paprika</li>
    <li>1 tbsp white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tsp pickle relish or finely chopped gherkin</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Here's a tasty tip: pour boiling water over those onions in a small bowl until they're just covered, then let them cool down. Meanwhile, in another bowl, mix up all the sauce ingredients, adding a tablespoon of that now-cooled onion water. Stir until it's all beautifully blended, and then set it aside for burger magic!</li>
       <br>
        <li>Time to create bun magic! Split two of your burger buns in half, and for the other two, slice a thick chunk from the middles. Toast or grill the middle slices on both sides and the cut sides of the other buns, and then set them aside. Now, preheat your oven to a cozy 100°C (80°C fan/gas 2).</li>
       <br>
        <li>Let's burger it up! Divide the minced meat into four portions, season them up. Heat ¼ tbsp of oil in a heavy pan over high heat. Place one meat portion in the pan, cover with parchment, and press it down with another pan for 10 seconds. Remove the weight and paper, let it cook for 2 minutes, then flip, press with a spatula, and cook for 1 more minute. Keep it warm in the oven while you repeat for the others.</li>
     <br>
        <li>Time to build those burgers! Sauce on the bun bottoms, onions, lettuce, cheese, patty, gherkins, and a toasted bun middle. More sauce, onions, lettuce, another patty, and bun tops. If you like, serve with oven fries and extra sauce on the side. Enjoy!</li>
