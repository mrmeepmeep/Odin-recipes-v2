    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the base, mix flour, yeast, and salt in a big bowl. Create a well, add 200ml warm water and olive oil. Stir until it forms a soft, slightly wet dough. Knead for 5 mins on a floured surface until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. Rising is optional for a thin crust.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Time for sauce magic! Combine passata, basil, and crushed garlic, and give it a little seasoning love. Let it chill at room temperature while you work your doughy wonders on the base.
        <br>  
        <li>Let's get rollin'! If your dough has risen, give it a quick knead, then divide it into two portions. On a floured surface, roll each piece into thin, 25cm-wide circles using your rolling pin. Carefully transfer these dough discs onto two floured baking sheets – they're ready for the pizza party!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Get ready to bake! Preheat your oven to a blazing 240°C (220°C fan/gas 8) with an extra tray on the top shelf. Spread sauce, cheese, tomatoes, olive oil, and seasoning on your pizza bases.

            Place one pizza (still on its sheet) onto the hot tray and bake for 8-10 minutes until crispy and golden. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and, if you like, fresh basil leaves. Repeat for the second pizza, and you're set to enjoy!</li>
