    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Perfect French fries with our easy recipe – you'll end up with lightly golden, crisp fries. They're great as a snack or side dish to a Friday night feast</p>
    <p>Get ready for some fry-tastic fun! Today, we're whipping up a batch of golden, crispy French fries that are nothing short of perfection. We'll slice those potatoes into thin, uniform sticks, giving them a quick dip in hot oil until they're irresistibly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Sprinkle them with a pinch of salt, and you've got yourself a plate of addictive, melt-in-your-mouth fries that will vanish faster than you can say "Bon appétit!"</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg Odin or King Edward potatoes</li>
        <li>vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into 1cm-thick batons. Put into a bowl of cold water and leave to soak for at least 2 hrs to remove the starch from the potatoes – this will help them crisp while frying.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let's fry it up! After draining and patting dry those potatoes, heat some oil in a deep pan to around 140°C (when a bread cube turns golden in 60 seconds). Fry the fries in batches for about 6 minutes each until they're a lovely golden color, cooked through, and lightly crispy. Drain them on kitchen paper, and you're set for some delicious crispy bites!</li>
        <br>
        <li>Turn the heat up until the oil reaches 180C, or a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. Fry the French fries again for 2-3 mins per batch until lightly golden and really crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and immediately season with sea salt. Enjoy!</li>
